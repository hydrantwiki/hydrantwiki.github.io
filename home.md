# Welcome to HydrantWiki

HydrantWiki is designed to allow everyone to assist in the creation of a geographic database of fire hydrants.  The approach is to have users tag fire hydrants with a photo and position during their normal daily activities.  These hydrant tags are then verified by other users and a hydrant position is created (or refined).

The Hydrant Tagging Application can be found <a title="HydrantWiki HTML5 App" href="http://app.hydrantwiki.com/tagapp" target="_blank">here</a>.  It is a built as a HTML 5 web application.

Once you have collected Hydrant Tags you can review them and manage them with the full web application at this <a href="http://app.hydrantwiki.com" target="_blank">location</a>.
