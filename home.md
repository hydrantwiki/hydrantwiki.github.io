# Welcome to HydrantWiki

HydrantWiki is designed to allow everyone to assist in the creation of a geographic database of fire hydrants.  The approach is to have users tag fire hydrants with a photo and position during their normal daily activities.  These hydrant tags are then verified by other users and a hydrant position is created (or refined).
