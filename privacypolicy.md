###GPS Data and Images

The uploading of Hydrant GPS location and Images is entirely optional and not a prerequisite for using HydrantWiki. If you do submit Hydrant Tag the images and GPS data is uploaded via the HydrantWiki api. These are kept as raw files, as well as imported into the database and . 

###Email Adresses
The registered email address for an HydrantWiki user account, will never intentionally be published on the internet anywhere, shared with third party organizations, or revealed directly to other logged in users. Email addresses will be used by the server to notify the user if another user has sent a message through the website. Only System Administrators will have direct access to email address data. It may be used by these people to contact users directly about their Hydrant Tags or other HydrantWiki related issues.

###Account Removal
You can request your account to be removed and we will honor such requests as far as possible.  If you have contributed Hydrant Tags, your account will be renamed to a random userid, and contributions will be retained with this name.
