Today I launched a new version of the system.  The back end has been completely rewritten.  Existing users may need to reset their passwords to access the system.

Key Changes

  * Completely open sourced code.
  * Improved history of tags
  * Migrated away from DynamoDB to MongoDB
  * NancyFx is the web framework that is now used to control the rendering of the pages
  * Upgrade to latest MapBox api.

What&#8217;s coming soon.

  * Ability to tag hydrants with the Yo application.
  * Ability to export a GeoJson list of all hydrants.
