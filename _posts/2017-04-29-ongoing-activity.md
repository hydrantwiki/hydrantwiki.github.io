Activity has been ongoing for a while, but with nothing major to show so far.

Goals for this burst.

1. Rehost the API
1. Launch iOS and Android native applications in the appropriate stores
1. Implement leader boards - Daily and All Time
1. Daily dump of data
1. Upgrade the API to support MongoDB 3.4


Status - Most of the mobile application is complete and final testing is in progress now.
