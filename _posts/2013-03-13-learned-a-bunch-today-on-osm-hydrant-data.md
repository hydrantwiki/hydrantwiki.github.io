I learned today that I was missing several fields of extended information on the fire hydrants that were data collected in OpenStreetMap.  Thanks to Richard for that info.

I have started to make changes to make sure this data is imported and is easily viewable in the Hydrant map.  The good news is that the merge of the data looks very easy to do on my side.  The beauty of NoSQL is that it allows for quick changes in the data being stored on any particular row.
