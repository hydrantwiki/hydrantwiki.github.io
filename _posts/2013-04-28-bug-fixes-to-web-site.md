I have been very busy with work stuff and haven&#8217;t been able to dedicate much time lately to HydrantWiki.  I fixed some login issues that have been causing problems.  The form was firing the wrong button by default (enter pressed).  This caused the user to end up at the register page instead of logging in.  Very confusing.  Sorry about that.  Should be fixed now.
