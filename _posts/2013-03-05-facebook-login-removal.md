I am going to be moving away from the facebook login.  It has flaws on the iOS devices that keep it from working as cleanly as I would like.

The new system will allow users to sign up on the HydrantWiki website.  Then the HTML5 tagging app will use those credentials to connect.  If users attempt to register from the HTML5 app it will pop open a new web window with the website registration page.

I will be implementing a native HydrantWiki login over the next week.  The hydrant map is coming along nicely.  It is on target for being complete by 03/11/2013.
