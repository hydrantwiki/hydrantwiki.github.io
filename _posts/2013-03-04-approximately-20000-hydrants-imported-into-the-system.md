I have imported about 20k hydrants in the United States into the system from data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).  I will be importing more through out the world over the next weeks.

The next step for the site is to allow the viewing of the hydrants on the Map.  This screen will be developed to show all hydrants from OpenStreetMap as well as Hydrants that were identified in HydrantWiki.  Proper attribution will be given to each tag as it is viewed on the map as to the source and user.

Currently on photographs are only available on HydrantWiki tagged hydrants.

The next step after hydrants are displayed is to push new data back into OpenStreetMap to improve the overall quality of the global data stored in OpenStreetMap system.
