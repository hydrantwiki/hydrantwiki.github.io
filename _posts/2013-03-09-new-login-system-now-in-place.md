A new login system has now been implemented for the HydrantWiki site.  You can register for an account at by going to the [main application page](http://app.hydrantwiki.com) and clicking the &#8220;Create Account&#8221; button.

The first cut of the United States Hydrant Map is now available.  The map uses a Heat Map for zooms 1 through 12.  The heat map gives users a quick indication of where there is hydrant data already collected.  The Hydrant Heat Map will be regenerated weekly to include the latest hydrant additions.

After zoom 12 individual push pins are available that  detail out where the hydrant was captured.  When you click on a specific push pin the hydrant details will be displayed on the right.  The Latitude and Longitude, the primary photo, and any Hydrant Taggers that have tagged the hydrant will be shown.  It will indicate which system the tag originated from either HydrantWiki or OpenStreetMap.
